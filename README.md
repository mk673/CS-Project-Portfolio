# Introduction
My name is Merriam Khan, and I am an Honors student at Georgia State University majoring in Computer Science. While much of my learning has been bound by academic learning, I am eager to utilize my technical skills and apply it in a corporate work environment. Below are some projects that I have completed that I feel represent my versatile skillset with regards to my techincal skills. I hope that by gaining experience in a professional setting, I will not only be able to enhance these skills, but also strengthen my interpersonal skills and work in a team.

# Projects
## In-Fix Calculator
- Designed a program that accepts a mathematical, in-fix expression from the user and calculates the total result
- Utilized stacks to organize the operators and operands and linearly calculate and simplify the result while passing through the expression only once
- The program also handles invalid expressions as input by alerting the user of the error

## Processing Directories
- Developed a program that processes a directory in the computer system (which is given by the user) and lists the existing files in that directory as well as their attributes
- Attributes include file name, user ID, group ID, file type, file size, and timestamp
- Employed system-level programming techniques in C and UNIX, such as readdir and stat, as well as processed arguments from the command line, to complete the task, handle any exceptions, and offer a help information display as a part of the program.

## Pizza Builder
- Designed a 'Read States' program that allows the user to pick a state in the U.S. using a drop-down menu and see all the cities in that state
- Utilized Swing, Exception Handling, Event Handling, Input/Output Streams, and File Reading in Java to dynamically list the cities of a given U.S. as input by the user

## Tip Calculator Application
- Developed a fully-functional Tip Calculator Android (Version 11+) App using Kotlin
- The application calculates the tip of a given bill amount by accepting a tip percentage using a seekbar
- Self-taught how to build mobile apps by doing research using online articles, tutorial videos, as well as university provided labs
