# Introduction
My name is Merriam Khan, and I am an Honors student at Georgia State University majoring in Computer Science with a specialization in Data Science. Below are some projects that I have completed that I feel represent my versatile skillset with respect to my technical skills, along with interpersonal skills I honed and developed as I learned to navigate working with team members and communicating project goals. I hope that by gaining experience in a professional setting, I will be able to enhance these skills as well as challenge myself into expanding my horizons and stepping outside of my comfort zone to learn new skills.

- Incorporated features such as employee lookup, **report generation**, and flexible information modifications
- Crafted a detailed **software design** report, illustrated sequence and use case diagrams, and recorded a comprehensive video explaining the system’s features
- Delegated tasks to team members and implemented regular check-ups to ensure timely completion of the project

## Control-F Utility Program (April 2024)
- Recreated the Control-F finding utility in **Assembly**, compatible with the **Netwide Assembler** for the Intel x86 architecture
- Utilized standard input/output and modular programming to process input and find all locations of the given word or phrase to find in the text
- Implemented a debugging system to help catch coding errors and improve utility function

## KPMG Data Analysis Experience   (December 2023)
- Analyzed high volumes of data for quality issues and offered strategies to improve **data collection**
- Designed a **PowerPoint** presentation illustrating how to target high-value audience based on demographics and attributes, and created an artistic dashboard with **Tableau** to visualize data

## Prisoner's Dilemma Game   (December 2023)
- Developed an iterative, multi-process game utilizing the Prisoner's Dilemma **game theory**, which involves two players unable to communicate with each other, but must make a choice to cooperate or betray each other.
- Implemented forking and **multi-process communication** to simulate a referee and two players, each with independent decision-making modules.
- Utilized standard library functions to keep track of scores, and analyze players' moves to simulate 'influenced' decision-making and strategy performance for each player.

## Processing Directories    (November 2023)
- Developed a program that dynamically processes a user-given directory in the computer system and lists the existing files in that directory as well as their attributes.
- Attributes include file name, user ID, group ID, file type, file size, and timestamp.
- Employed **system-level programming** techniques, such as readdir and stat, to process user input from the command line, handle errors in retrieving data, and offer a help information display option.

## Calculator Program   (October 2023)
- Designed a user-friendly arithmetic calculator in **Python** that computes any given mathematical expression
- Utilized core data structures, such as **stacks**, and algorithms to linearly compute the expression by passing through it only once, and implemented Exception-Handling techniques to deal with any invalid expressions

## Tip Estimator Android Application (January 2023)
- Developed a fully functional Tip Estimator **Android (Version 11+) App** using **Kotlin** that calculates the tip of any given bill amount by accepting a tip percentage using a seekbar
- Self-taught how to build **mobile apps** through research via online articles, tutorial videos, and university labs.

## Pizza Builder   (December 2022)
- Designed user-friendly **pizza builder interface** allowing the user to custom-build a personal pizza.
- Utilized Swing, Exception and Event Handling, and Input/Output Streams in Java to include dynamic topping selections, configurable pricing, and **efficient data management** to effectively handle user input.

## List States and Cities Program (December 2022)
- Designed a user-interactive program allowing the user to choose a U.S. state from a dynamic selection interface and see a curated list of the cities in the chosen U.S. state
- Utilized **Java Swing**, **Exception and Event Handling**, **Input/Output Streams**, and **File Reading** to generate the user interface and efficiently handle user input to deliver the expected content

## Tuition Research Project (April 2022)
- Worked on and presented a months-long research assignment to compare the education systems of the United States and Europe’s public universities.
- Researched and analyzed the financial, social, and academic effects of tuition on students in Europe and the United States, specifically with regards to budgeting, diversity levels in universities, and exam results.
- Prepared a **video research proposal**, conducted interviews, and wrote a **lengthy research paper** illustrating results from the 4-month long project.
