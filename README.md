# Introduction
My name is Merriam Khan, and I am an Honors student at Georgia State University majoring in Computer Science. While much of my learning is comprised of academic learning, I am eager to utilize my technical skills and apply it in a corporate work environment. Below are some projects that I have completed that I feel represent my versatile skillset with regards to my technical skills. I hope that by gaining experience in a professional setting, I will not only be able to enhance these skills, but also learn how to effectively contribute to a team and strengthen my interpersonal skills.

# Projects
## Prisoner's Dilemma Game   (December 2023)
- Developed an iterative, multi-process game utilizing the Prisoner's Dilemma game theory, which involves two players unable to communicate with each other, but must make a choice to cooperate or betray each other.
- Implemented forking and multi-process communication to simulare a referee and two players, each with independent decision-making modules.
- Utilized standard library functions to keep track of scores, and analyze players' moves to simulate 'influenced' decision-making and strategy performance for each player.

## Processing Directories    (November 2023)
- Developed a program that dynamically processes a user-given directory in the computer system and lists the existing files in that directory as well as their attributes.
- Attributes include file name, user ID, group ID, file type, file size, and timestamp.
- Employed system-level programming techniques, such as readdir and stat, to process user input from the command line, handle errors in retrieving data, and offer a help information display option. 

## Pizza Builder             (December 2022)
- Designed user-friendly pizza builder interface allowing the user to custom-build a personal pizza.
- Utilized Swing, Exception and Event Handling, and Input/Output Streams to include dynamic topping selections, configurable pricing, and efficient data management to effectively handle user input.
